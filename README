audit-testsuite: A Basic Audit Regression Test for the Linux Kernel
===============================================================================
https://github.com/linux-audit/audit-testsuite

The audit-testsuite project provides a simple, self-contained regression test
for the Linux Kernel's audit subsystem.

* Online Resources

The testsuite source repository currently lives on GitHub at the following URL:

	-> https://github.com/linux-audit/audit-testsuite

* Dependencies

The audit-testsuite depends on the Perl 5 Test and Test::Harness modules.
Sample commands for installing these dependencies on various distributions are
given below:

	Fedora / RHEL based systems
	# dnf install perl \
	              perl-Test \
	              perl-Test-Harness \
	              perl-File-Which \
	              perl-Time-HiRes \
	              glibc.i686 \
	              glibc-devel.i686

	RHEL-7.x also requires
	# dnf install libgcc.i686

	Debian based systems
	# apt-get install perl-modules \
	                  libc6-i386

* Running the Tests

The tests can be run using the following commands, executed as root from the
top level directory of the audit-testsuite on the system running the kernel
under test:

	# make
	# make test

It is also possible to execute just a specific subset of all tests, eg.:

        # SUBDIRS="exec_name file_create"  make -e test

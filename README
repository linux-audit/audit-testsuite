audit-testsuite: A Basic Audit Regression Test for the Linux Kernel
===============================================================================
https://github.com/linux-audit/audit-testsuite

The audit-testsuite project provides a simple, self-contained regression test
for the Linux Kernel's audit subsystem.

* Online Resources

The testsuite source repository currently lives on GitHub at the following URL:

	-> https://github.com/linux-audit/audit-testsuite

* Installation

The audit-testsuite requires audit, C compiler (gcc), Perl 5 and its modules
Test, Test::Harness and File::Which. Some tests require 32-bit glibc packages.
        
To install all these dependencies on your distribution on x86_64 architecture
please follow the instructions below:

        RHEL / Centos
	# yum install audit             \
                      gcc               \
                      glibc.i686        \
                      glibc-devel.i686  \
                      perl perl-Test    \
                      perl-Test-Harness \
                      perl-File-Which

        Fedora
	# dnf install audit             \
                      gcc               \
                      glibc.i686        \
                      glibc-devel.i686  \
                      perl perl-Test    \
                      perl-Test-Harness \
                      perl-File-Which

	Debian
	# apt-get install auditd          \
                          build-essential \
                          libc6-i386      \
                          perl-modules

* Execution

Please notice that tests are changing kernel audit rules and hence it might be
a good idea to back them up prior testing and restore them afterwards. The tests
need to be executed as root.

Execute the following commands from audit-testsuite directory:

        To build all tests
        # make

        To list all tests
        # make list

        To execute all tests
        # make test

        To execute a subset of all tests
        # TESTS="test1 test2 ..." make -e test
